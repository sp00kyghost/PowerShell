# PowerShell
PowerShell scripts that are labeled correctly, and describe the purpose of the script.

'Control-M-Connection-Test' allows you to remote connect into a server, with proper credentials. This script contains a command that executes a perl script, to kill Job / Order ID's inside Control-M after a successful connection.

'Control-M-Running-Script' allows you to remote connect into a server. After connecting, it will gather the running services (pertaining to Control-M but can be changed to all services or different.) and then shout them out to a teams channel via webhook url.
